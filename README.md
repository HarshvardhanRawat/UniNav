UniNav 🧭

Smart Campus Navigation System

📌 Overview

UniNav is a smart, AI-powered campus navigation system designed to help students, faculty, and visitors easily find classrooms, labs, offices, and other important locations within large university campuses.

Users can simply ask questions like “Where is Room 105?”, and UniNav responds with accurate room-level navigation details including building, floor, landmarks, and a Google Maps link.

❓ Problem Statement

Large university campuses are often confusing and difficult to navigate, especially for first-year students and visitors. The absence of a centralized, room-level navigation system leads to wasted time, stress, and missed classes or meetings.

💡 Solution

UniNav solves this problem by combining structured campus data with an AI-powered assistant. It provides fast, accurate, and user-friendly navigation through natural language queries and Google-integrated location services.
